A Kubernetes device plugin for the Intel Neural Compute Stick 2 (NCS2) / Intel Movidius MyriadX

## Quick Start

To directly install `ncs2-device-plugin` as a `DaemonSet` into the Kubernetes cluster:

```
$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adaptant-labs/ncs2-device-plugin/ncs2-device-plugin.yaml
```

Pods will be scheduled on any node with a `feature.node.kubernetes.io/usb-ff_03e7_2485.present` (provided by [NFD]) or
`accelerators/ncs2` (provided by [k8s-auto-labeller], in combination with NFD-based discovery) label set. These labels
can also be set manually on NCS2-capable nodes for simple deployments in order to enqueue the Pod.

## Annotations

Annotations are produced for the per-device full device name, allowing for different device types to be explicitly
targeted, regardless of their insertion order into the system:

```
# For a single device
ncs2.intel.com/MYRIAD.name: Intel Movidius Myriad X VPU

# For multiple devices
ncs2.intel.com/MYRIAD.0.name: Intel Movidius Myriad X VPU
...
```
## Node Labels

Node labels are produced for the number of devices and per-device optimization capabilities:

```
intel.com/ncs2=<number of NCS2 devices>

# For a single device
ncs2.intel.com/MYRIAD.FP16=true

# For multiple devices
ncs2.intel.com/MYRIAD.0.FP16=true
...
```

## USB Hotplug Event Reconciliation

Node labels and annotations are reconciled on the node each time a USB device is added or removed from the system. This
can be seen below:

```
